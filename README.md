# ScamLibs
this is a scam email generator that follows the logic of Mad Libs.
Drawing inspiration from the formulaic narrative of the Scam email (“Advance-fee scam” or 419), to be nothing more than a template for a game of Mad Libs, Scam Libs is an attempt at creating the ‘customizable’ scam email, a virtual utopia in which the role of the user, programmer and scammer are interchangeable.
